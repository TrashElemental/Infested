      "Armor made using a Spider Armor Trim. The Hood provides Night Vision, and the Chestpiece increases damage against entities trapped in cobwebs. While wearing the full set, you can shift right click on a block with an empty hand to obtain four Cobweb Traps, consuming some durability in the process. A cobweb trap will also spawn under you when you are attacked. The boots allow you to ignore the slowness from these traps."
